<h3>Maori language stats from New Zealand Census data (mostly 2001,2006, 2013)</h3>
<p>	Due to the Christchurch earthquake in 2011, the time series is irregular. 
	I am interested in trends, not absolute numbers which contain both error and probably 
	over reporting on the language question.</p> 
<p>	Figure 1 displays the number of Maori by descent, ethnicity and Maori language 
	speakers (only those claiming Maori ethnicity), from 1991 and includes a rough 
	projection to 2021, the most likely date of the next New Zealand census.</p>
<p><img src="images/ms1plot01.png" alt="Figure 1" class="inline"/></p>
<p>	Question on language use has only been asked since 2001. Figure 1, shows there has 
	been a reasonably consistent increase in the number of Maori claiming Maori descent 
	and Maori ethnicity, but a reasonably steady decrease in the number of Maori language 
	speakers.</p>

<p>	Figure 2 displays Maori language speakers (only those of Maori ethnicity) by 4 age 
	groups. This clearly shows that in terms of absolute numbers there have been 
	reasonably consistent decreases in all age groups (from 2001 to 2013), with the 
	exception of those of over the age of 64.</p>
<p><img src="images/ms1plot02.png" alt="Figure 2" class="inline"/></p>

<p>	Figure 3 displays the number of Maori language speakers by Region, from 2001 to 2013.
	There was a consistent decrease across all regions since 2006. The Bay of Plenty, 
	Gisborne, Waikato and Northland have always had large Maori populations. Auckland 
	now has a large number of Maori residents as a result of internal migration. </p>
<p><img src="images/ms1plot03.png" alt="Figure 3" class="inline"/></p>

<p> Figure 4 displays the percentage of Maori language speakers by region. I.e., 
	what percentage of the Maori population (in that region) claim to be speakers of 
	Maori. There are larger percentages of Maori speakers where there are higher 
	percentages of Maori, although the reasons for this are historic and largely reflect 
	delayed language shift in rural areas where Maori communities are still intact.</p>
<p><img src="images/ms1plot04.png" alt="Figure 4" class="inline"/> </p>

<p>	Figure 5 displays percentage of speakers by the percentage of the population for 
	each region as a scatter plot. In some ways this is kind of collapsing or 
	combining figures 3 and 4. There is a positive correlation between these variables.</p>
<p><img src="images/ms1plot05.png" alt="Figure 5" class="inline"></p>

<p>	In some cases regional analyses can be misleading, as there is a lot of 
	variation in regions such as Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. This needs to be explored 
	by looking at next level, i.e., District Councils (yes I am planning to do this).</p>

<p>	Where to from here ? First, I'll look at iwi (Maori tribes). I have requested additional
        data from Stats NZ, but will not get it until the end of March or later. Then I'll look at
        'defacto' social class measures such as income and education. I will also add data on Maori 
        and Maori speakers in Australia.</p>

<p>	Figures were done in <a href="http://r-project.org"> R </a> (ggplot2) using 
	<a href="http://rstudio.com"> RStudio </a>on a MacBook Pro. Github repo is 
	<a href="https://github.com/peterjkeegan/MaoriStats01.git">here</a>. Figures were
	exported from R as PDFs and then re-sized and resolution increased in Illustrator.</p>
