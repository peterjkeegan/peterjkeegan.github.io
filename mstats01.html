<h3>Maori language stats from New Zealand Census data (mostly 2001, 2006, 2013)</h3>
<p>	Due to the Christchurch earthquake in 2011, the NZ Census time series is irregular.
	I am interested in trends, not absolute numbers. I suspect that there is
	a lot of over reporting on the language question.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3> Overview, the big picture</h3>
<p>	Figure 1 presents the number of Maori by descent, ethnicity and Maori language
	speakers (only those claiming Maori ethnicity), from 1991 and includes a rough
	projection to 2021, the most likely date of the next New Zealand census.</p>
<p><img src="images/ms1plot01.png" alt="Figure 1" class="inline"></p>
<p>	Question on language use has only been asked since 2001. Figure 1, shows there has
	been a reasonably consistent increase in the number of Maori claiming Maori descent
	and Maori ethnicity, but a reasonably steady decrease in the number of Maori language
	speakers.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3> Maori Language Speakers by 4 Age Groups</h3>
<p>	Figure 2 presents Maori language speakers (only those of Maori ethnicity) by 4 age
	groups. </p>
<p><img src="images/ms1plot02.png" alt="Figure 2" class="inline"></p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2 clearly shows that in terms of absolute numbers there have been
  reasonably consistent decreases in all age groups (from 2001 to 2013), with the
	exception of those of over the age of 64.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Maori Language Speakers by NZ Census Regions</h3>
<p>Figure 3 displays the number of Maori language speakers by Region, from 2001 to 2013.
<p><img src="images/ms1plot03.png" alt="Figure 3" class="inline"></p>
  The Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, Waikato and Northland have always had large Maori populations.
  Auckland now has a large number of Maori residents as a result of internal migration. </p>
<p>It appears that in many regions there were increases in 2006, but consistent decreases in 2013.
  More on this below.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4 displays the percentage of Maori language speakers by region. I.e.,
	what percentage of the Maori population (in that region) claim to be speakers of
	Maori. </p>
<p><img src="images/ms1plot04.png" alt="Figure 4" class="inline"> </p>
<p>There are larger percentages of Maori speakers where there are higher
  percentages of Maori, although the reasons for this are historic and largely reflect
	delayed language shift in rural areas where Maori communities are still intact.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>	Figure 5 displays percentage of speakers by the percentage of the population for
	each region as a scatter plot. In some ways this is kind of collapsing or
	combining figures 3 and 4. </p>
<p><img src="images/ms1plot05.png" alt="Figure 5" class="inline"></p>
<p>There is a positive correlation between these variables.</p>
<p>	Note that there is a lot of variation in regions such as Auckland and the Bay of Plenty.
  More on this later.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Maori Language Speakers by Census Iwi Regions</h3>
<p><b>Maori identify with multply iwi (tribes), around 2.3/2.4</b></p>
<p>Iwi Regions should be regardes as 'Iwi Region of Origin' as the vast majority
of Maori live outside of their Iwi region.</p>
<p> Iwi regions are combinations or groups of related iwi.</p>

<p>	Figures were done in <a href="http://r-project.org"> R </a> (ggplot2) using
	<a href="http://rstudio.com"> RStudio </a> on a MacBook Pro. Github repo is
	<a href="https://github.com/peterjkeegan/MaoriStats01.git">here</a>.
  Figures were exported from R. Figure 5 was touched up in Pixelmator.</p>
